# 🚀 Miner Performance Improvement Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive strategies to improve your miner's incentive and emission scores in the Precog subnet.

## 🔍 Why Your Incentive/Emission Are Decreasing

### 1. **Moving Average System Impact**
- Your scores use exponential moving average with `alpha = 0.05`
- **95%** of your score comes from historical performance
- **Only 5%** comes from recent predictions
- **Half-life**: ~14 iterations (2 hours at 5-minute intervals)

### 2. **Performance Ranking System**
- **Point Predictions**: Ranked by Absolute Percentage Error (lower error = higher rank)
- **Interval Predictions**: Ranked by inclusion × width factors (higher score = higher rank)
- **Decay Factor**: 0.8 creates exponential weight distribution

### 3. **Competition Factor**
- Your performance is relative to other miners
- If other miners improve while you stay the same, your ranking decreases

## 🎯 Immediate Improvements Implemented

- Provides optimized settings for better performance
- Generates performance-focused environment files

## 🔧 How to Apply the Improvements

### Step 1: Backup Your Current Setup
```bash
# Backup your current miner configuration
cp .env.miner .env.miner.backup
cp precog/miners/advanced_ensemble_miner.py precog/miners/advanced_ensemble_miner.py.backup
```

### Step 2: Apply the Enhanced Miner
The enhanced `advanced_ensemble_miner.py` now includes:
- Real-time performance tracking
- Better prediction accuracy monitoring

- Comprehensive performance logging

### Step 3: Optimize Your Configuration
```bash
# Run the configuration optimizer
python optimize_miner_config.py

# Apply the optimized configuration
cp .env.miner.optimized .env.miner
```

### Step 4: Restart Your Miner
```bash
# Restart your miner with the new configuration
pm2 restart miner

# Monitor the enhanced logs
pm2 logs miner --lines 100
```

### Step 5: Monitor Performance
```bash
# Run the performance monitor
python performance_monitor.py

# Check performance logs regularly
pm2 logs miner | grep -E "(Performance|Accuracy|Error)"
```

## 📊 Performance Monitoring Features

### Real-time Tracking
Your miner now logs:
- Point prediction errors for each asset
- Interval score performance
- Historical accuracy rates
- Performance summaries

### Performance Metrics
- **Average Point Error**: Mean prediction error
- **Accuracy Rate**: Percentage of predictions within 5% error
- **Interval Score**: Quality of interval predictions
- **Performance Score**: Overall performance rating

### Example Performance Logs
```
📊 btc Performance: Point Error: 0.0234 | Interval Score: 0.8765 | Avg Error: 0.0187
📊 eth Performance: Point Error: 0.0156 | Interval Score: 0.9234 | Avg Error: 0.0143
📊 Historical Performance Summary:
   btc: avg_error: 0.0187, accuracy_rate: 89.2%, avg_interval_score: 0.8765, predictions: 45
   eth: avg_error: 0.0143, accuracy_rate: 91.8%, avg_interval_score: 0.9234, predictions: 45
```
